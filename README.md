# Bitfields

Explore procedurally generated maps with other players, build bases and fight others in your web browser!

My latest project, a text-based .io style game powered by python, websockets and javascript canvas. Supports multiplayer and custom procedural map generation using simplex noise.

## This project is currently WORK IN PROGRESS!

## To get started:

Create a server inside `bitfields/server`: `python3 main.py`

Start frontend inside `bitfields/client`: `yarn dev` `(npm run dev)`

Head to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

OR alternatively

Export frontend as static web page for serverless use:

Inside `bitfields/client`: `yarn export` `(npm run export)`
